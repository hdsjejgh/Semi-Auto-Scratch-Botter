# Semi-Auto-Scratch-Botter
(this was made so i could learn selenium so it is for educational purposes only)

to use it make sure you have chrome web drivers
the deployBots() function in deployer.py does the botting. If you execute the file directly it'll automatically run the file
you have to confirm whether or not there is a captcha after submitting the email (if so you have to solve it)(the program wont continue unless you confirm or deny it)
the program has delays because chrome is slow
you can probably figure out how to use it
